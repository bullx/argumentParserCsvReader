All the files are in root location
Please run the solution using following options
Kindly refer to screenshot attached to see running of my program and all the requirements listed.
1) Open bash terminal
2) run file by ./run.sh
   This will run solution.py which contains my code. By default it will print only successful renderers
   Since there is no directory name specified it will current default working directory.   
   If you want to run with a directory name use following options
    ./run.sh "directoryname"
3) pass optional arguments like ./run.sh -app name
	example ./run.sh -app foo (where foo is name of the app)
4) other examples are
     ./run.sh -renderer baz (where baz is renderer name)
5) For getting the count of failed renderer
    ./run.sh -failed

6) script runs with all other optional arguments mentioned in requirements
